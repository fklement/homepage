#### Hi, I am Felix.

and I am from the beautiful Hallertau.

I am currently doing my master's degree in computer science and work as a freelance developer.

In addition to my daily work, I continue to work academically in computer science. I also enjoy working on open source projects and am a big fan of 3D printing.

#### Exploring
I like to travel and explore new countries and cities.

#### Tinkering
I've always been enthusiastic about technology, which is why I spend a lot of my free time doing tinkering and developing.

#### Outdoors
To switch off, I like walking outside, cycling or hiking in the mountains.

#### Voluntary work
Since I was 15 years old, I've been a passionate firefighter.

#### Hacking/Exploiting
I just recently started to use TryHackMe and I really like it.
